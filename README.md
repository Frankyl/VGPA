# VGPA

Variational Gaussian Process Approximation

This project contains a python implementation of the basic VGPA algorithm for approximate inference in SDEs.
The code refers to the initial algorithms as published in:

* C. Archambeau, D. Cornford, M. Opper, J. Shawe-Taylor, Gaussian process approximations of stochastic differential equations,
in: Journal of Machine Learning Research, Workshop and Conference Proceedings. vol. 1, 2007, pp. 1â€“16.

The code can deal with both 1-D and N-D systems. Examples include:

1 Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (1-D)
2 Double-Well (1-D)
3 Lorenz-63 (3-D)
4 Lorenz-98 (40D)
